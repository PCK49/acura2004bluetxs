    <h1>RIP</h1>
    <p>Built in 2003 as a 2004 model, the Acura TSX rolled into our lives with a quiet elegance and a coat of Arctic Blue Pearl that shimmered like a clear winter sky. It was our first — a symbol of new beginnings, a companion for everything that came next.</p>
    <p>In 2008, it made the journey with us to Oregon — the first of many drives between two states that became chapters of our life. Time after time, it carried us back and forth without hesitation, packed with bags, emotions, hopes, and memories.</p>
    <p>It handled the winding mountain roads, the endless interstates, and the silence of late-night highways. Through the years, it never asked for much — just fuel, care, and a little trust. In return, it gave us safety, reliability, and a sense of home on wheels.</p>
    <p>One winter, on an icy stretch of highway, the TSX hit black ice and spun a full 360 degrees. In that terrifying moment — time froze. But somehow, it straightened out. No crash. No injury. Just a quiet, shaken stop — and then the soft hum of the engine, ready to move forward again. We never forgot that day. It felt like the car was looking out for us.</p>
    <p>From then on, it became more than reliable transportation. It was a quiet guardian — one that had seen us through storms both on the road and in life.</p>
    <p>In 2025, after over two decades of memories, it was traded in for a new Tesla Model Y. But some trades cost more than dollars. Letting go of the TSX was like closing a door to the past — one filled with motion, music, laughter, and quiet comfort.</p>
    <p>We didn’t just give up a car. <br>
We gave up a piece of ourselves. <br>
A piece that once spun on ice and came out strong. <br>
A piece that always, somehow, got us home.</p>
    <p>Thank you for the miles. <br>
Thank you for the moments. <br>
You’ll always be part of our journey.
